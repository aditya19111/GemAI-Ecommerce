GemAI-Ecommerce is an intelligent, full-stack business intelligence application designed to democratize data access for e-commerce businesses. The project features a real-time, interactive dashboard built with Streamlit that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, including monthly revenue, inventory distribution, and sales by category.
The core of the application is a conversational AI assistant, powered by Google's Gemini Pro. This assistant uses advanced Text-to-SQL capabilities to understand complex user questions in plain English, generate the appropriate PostgreSQL query, and securely execute it against a live Supabase database. The results are then intelligently summarized and presented back to the user in a clear, concise format. Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, CommercePulse acts as a virtual data analyst, empowering non-technical team members to gain deep, actionable insights from their data instantly.
Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit share, Gemini Pro, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Pandas, Altair.
